        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome onboard In Your Shoes, a virtual travel experience platform that aims to challenge the way we perceive conventional travel. I am your Captain for today, and we hope you enjoy this short 5-minute journey with us. So, sit tight, buckle up and enjoy the presentation!
        <p>First, we would like to go into our problem statement. It is widely reported, and a well-known fact that the travel industry is taking a sharp nose-dive in this pandemic. Travellers are worried about the safety of inter-country travel, and many governments have shut their borders to foreign travellers, in a bid to decrease the number of imported cases. This has taken a disastrous toll on travel industries around the world, causing many local businesses to shutter. From the travellers’ viewpoint, many are itching to hop on a plane and experience something new, after surviving months of being stuck indoors. Travel could prove to bring tremendous long-lasting benefits for the well-being of travellers.</p>
        <P>And this is where our proposed solution takes flight. In Your Shoes is a virtual travel experience platform that aims to connect home-bound travellers with first-person experiences from across the globe, be it bustling cities, or rural mountains. We aim to work with governmental tourism boards, as well as locals of the featured countries. Through our platform, we aim to help rev up the engines of tourism industries, and bring local SMEs out of the clouds. The platform would also help satisfy the wanderlust of globetrotters, and push less well-known localities into the global spotlight. </P>
        <p>The strengths of the virtual experience lies in the fact that it can be experienced by anyone, anytime, anywhere. All you need is a device and a working Internet connection, in order to be in someone else’s shoes, and see the world through their eyes. What differentiates us from other competitors would be our offer of an in-person authentic travel experience. Say good-bye to heavily-edited staged shots, and hello to personal clips and live interactions! The experience is also perfectly customisable, with users being able to choose from a range of pre-filmed videos and themed live broadcasts, based on their personal interests. The base package would be made free, with the support from governmental tourism boards, and aims to introduce the key local attractions. The paid add-ons are experiences provided by locals and local businesses, and cover a wide range, from delving into hidden spots known only to locals, to following master chefs on a journey to learn more about traditional cuisines. The platform is accessible to anyone above the age of 13, and can be entirely free for users. There is also an option to travel virtually with friends, to emulate the social aspect of group travel. Interactive elements such as quizzes help keep users engaged. The quality and standard of experiences are also strictly regulated, with videos being vetted before being allowed onto the platform, guidelines on the type of content that can be streamed, age recommendations, and a reporting system for users to flag up errant experiences. A ranking system provides incentive for the continuous creation of better content, so that there is always something new to experience. </p>
