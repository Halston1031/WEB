        <p>Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial
            designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder
            of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board
            of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely
            recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple
            co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>
        <p>Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay
            Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in
            1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell
            Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II,
            one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the
            Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the
            development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the
            first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985
            with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was
            forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John
            Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
            development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he
            helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George
            Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature
            film Toy Story (1995).</p>
        <p>Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely
            responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with
            designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997
            with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store,
            iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac
            OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation
            for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of
            respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.。</p>

            <h2 id="B">Background</h2>
            <h3 id="B1">Biological and adoptive families</h3>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was
                adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs (née Hagopian).
                His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" (al-)Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. 1931), grew up
                in Homs, Syria, and was born into an Arab Muslim household. While an undergraduate at the American
                University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political
                activities. He pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a
                Catholic of Swiss and German descent. As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a
                course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age. Mona Simpson, Jobs's biological sister,
                notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating a Muslim. Walter
                Isaacson, author of the Steve Jobs biography, additionally states that Schieble's father "threatened to
                cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.
                Jobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs, was a Coast Guard mechanic. After leaving the Coast Guard,
                Paul Jobs married Clara Hagopian in 1946. Their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had
                an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption in 1955.</p>
            <h3 id="B2">Birth</h3>
            <p>"Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and
                we look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at
                exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention
                has taken form."
                —Steve Jobs, 1995. From the documentary, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview.<br />
                Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in
                Homs, Syria. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "without
                telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing,
                including me."
                Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him
                that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy," but the couple later changed their mind. Jobs was then
                placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign
                the adoption papers. She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a
                different family, and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after the couple pledged to
                pay for the boy's college education.
                When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that
                she "was too frightened to love for the first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to
                take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he
                was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared his mother's comment
                with Steve, he stated that he was already aware, and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by
                Paul and Clara. Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really
                blessed by having the two of them as parents." Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred
                to as his "adoptive parents"; he regarded them as his parents "1,000%". With regard to his biological
                parents, Jobs referred to them as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a
                sperm bank thing, nothing more."</p>

            <p>Paul worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist, several other jobs, and then "back to
                work as a machinist." Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and by 1959 the family had
                moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. It was during this time that Paul
                built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics." Jobs,
                meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a
                cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I
                wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad." By the time he was ten, Jobs
                was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.
                He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a
                "loner."</p>

            <h3 id="H">Homestead High</h3>

                title="Jobs's 1972 Homestead High School yearbook photo" />
            <p>The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School,
                which had strong ties to Silicon Valley. He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill
                Fernandez. (Fernandez introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would later be Apple's first employee.)
                Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided
                to enroll in John McCollum's "Electronics 1." McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair
                long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose
                interest in the class.</p>
            <p>He underwent a change during mid-1970: "I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan
                Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing
                classes."Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that "I started to listen to music a whole
                lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King
                Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked
                like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." During his last two years at
                Homestead High, Jobs developed two different interests: electronics and literature. These dual interests
                were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first
                girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.</p>
            <p>In 1971 after Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a
                few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student union. Jobs
                also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for
                Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as "kind of a brain and
                kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't
                nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was
                kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you
                weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where
                individuality was suspect." By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at
                Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan.</p>
            <p>Around that time, Wozniak designed a low-cost digital "blue box" to generate the necessary tones to
                manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Jobs decided then to sell them and
                split the profit with Wozniak. The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps
                planted the seed in Jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable. Jobs, in a 1994
                interview, recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to figure out how to build the blue
                boxes. Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an
                Apple". He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.</p>
            <p>By his senior year of high school, Jobs began using LSD. He later recalled that on one occasion he
                consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale, and experienced "the most wonderful feeling of my life
                up to that point". In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan
                rented a house from their other roommate, Al.</p>

            <h3 id="R">Reed College</h3>
            <p>In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He insisted on applying only to
                Reed although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford. Jobs soon befriended
                Robert Friedland, who was Reed's student body president at that time. Brennan remained involved with
                Jobs while he was at Reed. He later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the
                Reed campus, but she refused.</p>
            <p>After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents. Jobs later
                explained that he decided to drop out because he did not want to spend his parents' money on an
                education that seemed meaningless to him. He continued to attend by auditing his classes, which included
                a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino. In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford
                University, Jobs stated that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned
                Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same
                speech, Jobs said: "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac
                would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.</p>
